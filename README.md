# Developer-Profile-Generator

- When preparing a report for stakeholders, it is important to have up-to-date information about members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.

## Instructions

- Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username. The application will be invoked with the following command:
node index.js
The user will be prompted for a favorite color, which will be used as the background color for cards.
The PDF will be populated with the following:

Profile image
User name
Links to the following:

User location via Google Maps
User GitHub profile
User blog

User bio
Number of public repositories
Number of followers
Number of GitHub stars
Number of users following

- The objective of homework 9 is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile dependent on username and background color of choice, using node index.js. The concept of running code outside the browser seemed straight-forward and efficient, but it took me a while to understand the json packages and dependencies requirements. I also had major technical difficulties due to a previous version of node I had installed on my mac several years ago, it took Dan what seemed like 100 commands to delete and reinstall the latest node. I also hadn't offloaded a bunch of photos and deleted old emails which took up more than 80% of storage which made it impossible to update my OS and install node. Needless to say, it was a traumatic few days dealing with these technical issues which resulted in me falling behind a bit and had to catch up by re-doing activities, researching online, and getting lots of help from classmates.
